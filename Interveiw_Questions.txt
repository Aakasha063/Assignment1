Q9. What is the syntax for an "if" statement in Python?
Ans. The syntax for an "if" statement in Python is: if condition: statement.

Q10. What is the difference between "if" and "elif" statements in Python?
Ans."if" statements are used for a single condition while "elif" statements are used for multiple conditions.

Q11. What is a nested "if" statement in Python?

Looping Statements:

Q13. What is the difference between a "for" loop and a "while" loop in Python?
Ans. "for" loops are used when you know how many times you want to loop while "while" loops are used when you do not know how many times you want to loop.
